# TapTalk!

Built with Django, and hosted on Heroku: http://tap-talk.herokuapp.com

## Summary

## How to Run Locally

1. Download the project on GitHub.

2. If you haven't installed the project's dependencies, do so by double-clicking `install_dependencies.bat`.

3. Make sure that [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your machine.

4. Run the server by double-clicking `run.bat`. If there is an error, try editing the file and change `py` to `python`.

The server should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1/8000/admin`.

### Notes

The admin site can be accessed on `http://127.0.0.1/8000/admin/` but requires an admin email and password.

A copy of `config.py` containing secret API keys is to be placed in the root directory for the authentication functionalities to work.

To get a copy of `config.py` and the admin email and password, feel free to contact the developers of this project.
