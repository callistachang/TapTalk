# TapTalk

Built with Django, and hosted remotely on Heroku: http://tap-talk.herokuapp.com.

TapTalk is a plug-in for mobile webpages that sets people talking about what they have read. Users can now enjoy an enhanced news reading experience â€“ by participating in conversations while having weigh-in from experts.

We wanted to solve the problem of millennial users who are increasingly skeptical and detached with the way news is presented, and create an intuitive and alternative platform for them to participate and create conversations. 

Our plug-in allows users to comment on specific paragraphs of a news article, as well as filter out toxic comments to reduce clutter. A separate tab for experts in the related field can value-add and help the reader gain further insights on the issue discussed in the article.

## Demo

Watch our demo [here](https://youtu.be/2zlwXZdx6P0).

## Local Installation

1. Download the project on GitHub.

2. Make sure that [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your machine.

3. If the project's dependencies have not been installed, do so by double-clicking `install_dependencies.bat`.

4. Run the server by double-clicking `run.bat`. If there is an error, try editing the file by changing `py` to `python`.

The server should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1/8000`.

### Notes

The admin site can be accessed on `http://127.0.0.1/8000/admin/` but requires an admin email and password.

A copy of `config.py` containing secret API keys is to be placed in the root directory for the authentication functionalities to work.

To get a copy of `config.py` and the admin email and password, feel free to contact the developers of this project.
